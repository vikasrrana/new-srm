          <h1>WHAT IS TEDX?</h1>
          <p>In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxMAIT, where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxMAIT event, TED Talks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.</p>

           <h1>THEME</h1>
           <p>"An idea that is developed and put into action is more important than an idea that exists only as an idea." â€“ Buddha

    "From Ideas to Action", the theme of TEDxMAIT, focuses on the journey of an idea- the journey of an idea as it undergoes the transformation from a thought to an action.

    Every simple thing around us was once a humble idea. A thought that went on to become something huge. "From Ideas to Action" focuses on the process that transforms a minuscule, passing thought into a tangible service. Stories that inspired the idea, hard work that transformed and the execution that put the idea in front of the masses.

    With a spirit of inspiring, we plan to share the stories of people who were brave enough to believe and implement their ideas. Join us at TEDxMAIT to experience the grit and determination that turns a thought into action. And reignite the belief in your dream again!</p>
